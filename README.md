# 🏀 NBA MVP Prediction — Data Scraping & Cleaning

This repository contains the **data scraping** and **cleaning** pipeline for the NBA MVP Prediction project.  
The goal of this phase is to collect, parse, and clean player, team, and MVP voting data from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) for the seasons **1991–2025**.

---

## ⚙️ Phase 1 — Web Scraping

### 🧩 1. Scraping MVP Voting Data

**Context:**  
This script scrapes MVP voting tables for every year from 1991 to 2025 and saves each page as an HTML file in the `mvp/` folder.

**Code:**
```python
import requests
import time

base_url = "https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_{year}.html"

for year in range(1991, 2026):
    print(f"Fetching data for the year {year}...")
    url = base_url.format(year=year)
    html = requests.get(url).text
    with open(f"mvp/{year}.html", "w+", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        f.write(html)
    print(f"✅ Successfully saved {year}.html")
    time.sleep(3)
🧩 2. Extracting MVP Voting Data
Context:
Once HTML files are saved, this script parses all the mvp/ pages and extracts the MVP tables into a single CSV file named mvps.csv.

Code:

python
Copy code
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd
from io import StringIO
from pathlib import Path

files = sorted(Path("mvp").glob("*.html"))
dfs = []

for file in files:
    with open(file, encoding="utf-8") as f:
        page = f.read()
    soup = BeautifulSoup(page, "html.parser")
    table = soup.find(name="table")
    df = pd.read_html(StringIO(str(table)))[0]
    df["Year"] = file.stem
    dfs.append(df)

mvps = pd.concat(dfs)
mvps.to_csv("mvps.csv", index=False)
print("✅ Saved all MVP data to mvps.csv")
🧩 3. Scraping Player Statistics (Per Game)
Context:
This script uses Selenium to scrape player per-game stats for all seasons (1991–2025).
Each year’s page is stored as an HTML file in the player/ folder.

Code:

python
Copy code
from selenium import webdriver
import time, random
from pathlib import Path

Path("player").mkdir(exist_ok=True)

driver = webdriver.Chrome()

for year in range(1991, 2026):
    url = f"https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_{year}_per_game.html"
    print(f"Fetching data for {year}...")
    driver.get(url)
    time.sleep(random.uniform(3, 5))  # polite scraping delay
    html = driver.page_source
    with open(f"player/{year}.html", "w+", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        f.write(html)
    print(f"✅ Saved player stats for {year}")
    
driver.quit()
🧩 4. Extracting Player Statistics
Context:
This script parses all the player/ HTML files and extracts clean per-game statistics for each season.
The final dataset is saved as players.csv.

Code:

python
Copy code
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd
from io import StringIO
from pathlib import Path

files = sorted(Path("player").glob("*.html"))
all_players = []

for file in files:
    with open(file, encoding="utf-8") as f:
        page = f.read()
    soup = BeautifulSoup(page, "html.parser")
    table = soup.find("table", {"id": "per_game_stats"})
    df = pd.read_html(StringIO(str(table)))[0]
    df = df[df["Rk"] != "Rk"]  # remove header duplicates
    df["Year"] = file.stem
    all_players.append(df)

players = pd.concat(all_players)
players.to_csv("players.csv", index=False)
print("✅ Saved all player stats to players.csv")
🧩 5. Scraping Team Standings
Context:
This script scrapes NBA team standings (Eastern and Western Conferences) for each year from 1991 to 2025 and saves them to the team/ folder.

Code:

python
Copy code
import requests
import os
import time

os.makedirs("team", exist_ok=True)
base_url = "https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_{year}_standings.html"

for year in range(1991, 2026):
    print(f"Fetching standings for {year}...")
    url = base_url.format(year=year)
    html = requests.get(url).text
    with open(f"team/{year}.html", "w+", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        f.write(html)
    print(f"✅ Saved team standings for {year}")
    time.sleep(3)
🧩 6. Extracting Team Standings
Context:
This script extracts both Eastern and Western Conference standings from all saved team pages and combines them into one dataset (teams.csv).

Code:

python
Copy code
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd
from io import StringIO
from pathlib import Path

files = sorted(Path("team").glob("*.html"))
dfs = []

for file in files:
    with open(file, encoding="utf-8") as f:
        page = f.read()
    soup = BeautifulSoup(page, "html.parser")

    east = soup.find("table", {"id": "confs_standings_E"})
    west = soup.find("table", {"id": "confs_standings_W"})

    df_e = pd.read_html(StringIO(str(east)))[0]
    df_w = pd.read_html(StringIO(str(west)))[0]

    df_e["Conference"] = "East"
    df_w["Conference"] = "West"

    df = pd.concat([df_e, df_w])
    df["Year"] = file.stem
    dfs.append(df)

teams = pd.concat(dfs)
teams.to_csv("teams.csv", index=False)
print("✅ Saved all team standings to teams.csv")
🧹 Phase 2 — Data Cleaning
🔧 Cleaning Player Data
Context:
This script cleans and standardizes the player dataset:

Removes redundant columns and rows

Strips symbols like * from player names

Handles players traded mid-season (TOT team case)

Saves the cleaned dataset as players_cleaned.csv

Code:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

players = pd.read_csv("players.csv")
players = players[players["Player"].notna()]

# Clean names and drop unnecessary columns
players["Player"] = players["Player"].str.replace("*", "", regex=False)
players.drop(columns=["Rk"], inplace=True, errors="ignore")

# Handle duplicates (due to multiple teams)
players = players.groupby(["Player", "Year"], as_index=False).mean(numeric_only=True)

players.to_csv("players_cleaned.csv", index=False)
print("✅ Cleaned player data saved as players_cleaned.csv")
🔧 Cleaning MVP Data
Context:
This step ensures consistency in MVP dataset:

Keeps only essential columns

Fills missing MVP scores for players not in the vote list

Saves as mvps_cleaned.csv

Code:

python
Copy code
mvps = pd.read_csv("mvps.csv")

mvps = mvps[["Player", "Year", "Pts Won", "Pts Max", "Share"]]
mvps["Share"] = mvps["Share"].fillna(0)

mvps["Player"] = mvps["Player"].str.replace("*", "", regex=False)

mvps.to_csv("mvps_cleaned.csv", index=False)
print("✅ Cleaned MVP data saved as mvps_cleaned.csv")
🔧 Cleaning Team Data
Context:
This cleans the team dataset:

Removes division headers

Standardizes names

Converts numeric columns

Saves as teams_cleaned.csv

Code:

python
Copy code
teams = pd.read_csv("teams.csv")

teams = teams[teams["Team"] != "Division"]
teams["Team"] = teams["Team"].str.replace("*", "", regex=False)

teams.to_csv("teams_cleaned.csv", index=False)
print("✅ Cleaned team data saved as teams_cleaned.csv")
🧩 Final Combined Dataset
Context:
Finally, all three datasets (Players, MVPs, and Teams) are merged on common keys (Player, Year, Team) to form a unified dataset for analysis.

Code:

python
Copy code
players = pd.read_csv("players_cleaned.csv")
mvps = pd.read_csv("mvps_cleaned.csv")
teams = pd.read_csv("teams_cleaned.csv")

combined = players.merge(mvps, how="left", on=["Player", "Year"])
combined = combined.merge(teams, how="left", on=["Team", "Year"])

combined.fillna(0, inplace=True)
combined.to_csv("combined_data.csv", index=False)
print("✅ Final merged dataset saved as combined_data.csv")
